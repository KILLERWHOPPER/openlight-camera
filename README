# openlight-camera

This is an extraction and decompilation of the light L16 camera light_camera.apk 

## Setup

4 things are needed for compilation.

1) dex-tools (available here: https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar) needs a copy of a release build to tools/dex-tools. This has mainly been tested with version 2.4

2) the Android SDK, the location isn't specific. But an environment variable (ANDROID_PLATFORM) that points to the folder that contains android.sdk. 
example:
```
[cieric@laptop new-rebuild]$ echo $ANDROID_PLATFORM
/home/cieric/Android/Sdk/platforms/android-34/
```

3) a jdk of some kind is needed, java-17-openjdk is what's primarily tested against. javac needs to be available on the path.

4) the programs apktool, apksigner and unzip are all needed.
